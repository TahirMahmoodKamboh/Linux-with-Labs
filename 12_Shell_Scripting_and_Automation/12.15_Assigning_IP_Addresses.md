# Shell Scripting: Assigning IP Addresses

Automating network configuration is a common task for system administrators. These labs focus on assigning IP addresses using shell scripts.

---

## Lab 1: Assign a Static IP Address (ifconfig)
Write a script that assigns the IP address 192.168.1.100 with netmask 255.255.255.0 to interface eth0 using ifconfig.

---

## Lab 2: Assign a Static IP Address (ip command)
Write a script that assigns the IP address 10.0.0.50/24 to interface eth1 using the ip command.

---

## Lab 3: Assign IP Address from User Input
Write a script that prompts the user for an interface name and IP address, then assigns the IP using the ip command.

## Solutions

### Lab 1 Solution
```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
```

### Lab 2 Solution
```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.50/24 dev eth1
sudo ip link set eth1 up
```

### Lab 3 Solution
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter interface: " iface
read -p "Enter IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.101/24): " ipaddr
sudo ip addr add $ipaddr dev $iface
sudo ip link set $iface up
```
