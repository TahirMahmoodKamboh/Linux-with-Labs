# Shell Scripting: Security Best Practices

## Avoid Dangerous Patterns
- Never use unquoted variables in commands
- Validate user input

## Example: Quoting Variables
```bash
echo "$1"
```

## Use set -u and set -e
- set -u: Treat unset variables as errors
- set -e: Exit on error

## Principle of Least Privilege
- Run scripts with minimum required permissions

## Lab
1. Write a script that checks if a variable is set before using it.
2. Write a script that validates user input is a number.

## Solutions
1.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -u
if [ -z "${MYVAR:-}" ]; then
  echo "MYVAR is not set"
else
  echo $MYVAR
fi
```
2.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter a number: " num
if [[ $num =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  echo "Valid number"
else
  echo "Invalid input"
fi
```
