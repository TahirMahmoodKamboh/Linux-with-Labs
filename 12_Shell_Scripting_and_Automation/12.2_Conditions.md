# Shell Scripting: Conditions

## Conditional Statements
- if, else, elif
- Test expressions
- Using `[[` and `]]`

## Comparison Operators in Bash

### Numeric Comparison Operators
| Operator | Meaning                | Example                |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| -eq      | equal to               | [ "$a" -eq "$b" ]      |
| -ne      | not equal to           | [ "$a" -ne "$b" ]      |
| -gt      | greater than           | [ "$a" -gt "$b" ]      |
| -ge      | greater than or equal  | [ "$a" -ge "$b" ]      |
| -lt      | less than              | [ "$a" -lt "$b" ]      |
| -le      | less than or equal     | [ "$a" -le "$b" ]      |

#### Numeric Comparison Example
```bash
a=5
b=3
if [ $a -gt $b ]; then
  echo "$a is greater than $b"
fi
```

### String Comparison Operators
| Operator | Meaning                | Example                |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| =        | equal to               | [ "$str1" = "$str2" ]  |
| !=       | not equal to           | [ "$str1" != "$str2" ] |
| <        | less than (ASCII)      | [ "$str1" < "$str2" ]  |
| >        | greater than (ASCII)   | [ "$str1" > "$str2" ]  |
| -z       | string is empty        | [ -z "$str" ]          |
| -n       | string is not empty    | [ -n "$str" ]          |

#### String Comparison Example
```bash
str1="apple"
str2="banana"
if [ "$str1" != "$str2" ]; then
  echo "$str1 is not equal to $str2"
fi
```

#### String Length Example
```bash
str=""
if [ -z "$str" ]; then
  echo "String is empty"
fi
```

## Lab: Practice with Conditions

1. Write a script that compares two numbers and prints which is greater, or if they are equal.
2. Write a script that checks if a string is empty or not.
3. Write a script that checks if two strings are equal.
4. Write a script that checks if a file exists.
5. Create a script that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

## Solutions

1.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter first number: " a
read -p "Enter second number: " b
if [ $a -gt $b ]; then
  echo "$a is greater than $b"
elif [ $a -lt $b ]; then
  echo "$b is greater than $a"
else
  echo "Both numbers are equal"
fi
```

2.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter a string: " str
if [ -z "$str" ]; then
  echo "String is empty"
else
  echo "String is not empty"
fi
```

3.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter first string: " str1
read -p "Enter second string: " str2
if [ "$str1" = "$str2" ]; then
  echo "Strings are equal"
else
  echo "Strings are not equal"
fi
```

4.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ -f "$1" ]; then
  echo "File exists."
else
  echo "File does not exist."
fi
```

5.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter a number: " num
if [ $num -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "Positive"
elif [ $num -lt 0 ]; then
  echo "Negative"
else
  echo "Zero"
fi
```
