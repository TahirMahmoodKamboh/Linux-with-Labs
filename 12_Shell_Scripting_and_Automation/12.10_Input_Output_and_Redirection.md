# Shell Scripting: Input, Output, and Redirection

## Redirecting Output
```bash
echo "Hello" > file.txt # overwrite
echo "World" >> file.txt # append
```

## Redirecting Input
```bash
while read line; do
  echo $line
done < file.txt
```

## Pipes
```bash
cat file.txt | grep hello
```

## File Descriptors
- 0: stdin
- 1: stdout
- 2: stderr

## Redirecting stderr
```bash
ls /notfound 2> error.log
```
