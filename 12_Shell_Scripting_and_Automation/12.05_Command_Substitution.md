# Shell Scripting: Command Substitution

Command substitution allows you to use the output of a command as a value in your script.

## Syntax
- Using backticks: `command`
- Using $(): $(command)

## Examples

### Assigning command output to a variable
```bash
current_date=$(date)
echo "Today is: $current_date"
```

### Using command substitution in strings
```bash
echo "There are $(ls | wc -l) files in this directory."
```

## Lab
1. Write a script that prints the current working directory using command substitution.
2. Create a script that counts the number of users currently logged in.
