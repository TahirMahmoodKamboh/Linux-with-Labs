# Shell Scripting: Content Substitution with sed and More

Content substitution allows you to modify text in files or streams using tools like sed, awk, and tr.

## sed Examples

### Replace text in a file (output to terminal)
```bash
sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt
```

### Replace text in a file (in-place)
```bash
sed -i 's/old/new/g' file.txt
```

### Delete lines containing a pattern
```bash
sed '/pattern/d' file.txt
```

## tr Example
```bash
echo "HELLO" | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z'
```

## awk Example
```bash
echo "one two three" | awk '{print $2}'
```
