# Shell Scripting: Loops

## Loop Types
- for loops
- while loops
- until loops

---

## For Loop Examples

### 1. Loop over a range of numbers
```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo $i
done
```

### 2. Loop with C-style syntax
```bash
for ((i=1; i<=5; i++)); do
  echo $i
done
```

### 3. Loop over a list of words
```bash
for color in red green blue; do
  echo $color
done
```

### 4. Loop over files in a directory
```bash
for file in *.txt; do
  echo "Processing $file"
done
```

### 5. Loop over command output
```bash
for user in $(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd); do
  echo $user
done
```

## While Loop Examples

### 1. Basic while loop (counting)
```bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
  echo $count
  ((count++))
done
```

### 2. Read file line by line
```bash
while read line; do
  echo $line
done < file.txt
```

### 3. Infinite loop (with break)
```bash
while true; do
  read -p "Type 'exit' to quit: " input
  if [ "$input" = "exit" ]; then
    break
  fi
done
```

---

## Until Loop Examples

### 1. Basic until loop (counting)
```bash
count=1
until [ $count -gt 5 ]; do
  echo $count
  ((count++))
done
```

### 2. Wait for a file to exist
```bash
until [ -f myfile.txt ]; do
  echo "Waiting for myfile.txt..."
  sleep 1
done
echo "File found!"
```

### 3. User input with until
```bash
until [[ $answer == "yes" ]]; do
  read -p "Do you want to continue? (yes/no): " answer
done
echo "Continuing..."
```

## Lab: Practice with Loops

1. Write a script that prints numbers 1 to 5 using a for loop.
2. Create a script that reads lines from a file and prints them.

## Solutions

1. 
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo $i
done
```

2. 
```bash
#!/bin/bash
while read line; do
  echo $line
done < "$1"
```
