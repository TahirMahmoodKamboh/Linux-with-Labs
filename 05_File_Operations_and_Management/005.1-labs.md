# Module 5: Labs – File Operations & Management

## Lab 1: Create Files and Directories
- Create a directory called `testdir` and files inside it.
  ```bash
  $ mkdir testdir
  $ cd testdir
  $ touch file1.txt file2.txt
  $ ls
  file1.txt  file2.txt
  ```

## Lab 2: Copy Files and Directories
- Copy `file1.txt` to `file1_copy.txt` and copy the directory.
  ```bash
  $ cp file1.txt file1_copy.txt
  $ mkdir backup
  $ cp -r . backup/
  $ ls backup
  file1.txt  file1_copy.txt  file2.txt
  ```

## Lab 3: Move and Rename Files
- Rename `file2.txt` to `notes.txt` and move it to `backup`.
  ```bash
  $ mv file2.txt notes.txt
  $ mv notes.txt backup/
  $ ls backup
  file1.txt  file1_copy.txt  notes.txt
  ```

## Lab 4: Remove Files and Directories
- Remove `file1_copy.txt` and the `backup` directory.
  ```bash
  $ rm backup/file1_copy.txt
  $ rm -r backup
  $ ls
  file1.txt
  ```

## Lab 5: View File Contents
- Add text to `file1.txt` and view it with `cat`, `head`, and `tail`.
  ```bash
  $ echo -e "Line1\nLine2\nLine3" > file1.txt
  $ cat file1.txt
  Line1
  Line2
  Line3
  $ head -n 2 file1.txt
  Line1
  Line2
  $ tail -n 2 file1.txt
  Line2
  Line3
  ```

## Lab 6: File Information and Comparison
- Check file type, stats, and compare two files.
  ```bash
  $ file file1.txt
  file1.txt: ASCII text
  $ stat file1.txt
  # (Shows file statistics)
  $ cp file1.txt file2.txt
  $ diff file1.txt file2.txt
  # (No output, files are identical)
  $ echo "Extra" >> file2.txt
  $ diff file1.txt file2.txt
  3a4
  > Extra
  ```

## Solutions

### Lab 1 Solution
- `mkdir` creates a directory, `touch` creates files.
  ```bash
  $ mkdir testdir
  $ cd testdir
  $ touch file1.txt file2.txt
  $ ls
  file1.txt  file2.txt
  ```

### Lab 2 Solution
- `cp` copies files, `cp -r` copies directories.
  ```bash
  $ cp file1.txt file1_copy.txt
  $ mkdir backup
  $ cp -r . backup/
  $ ls backup
  file1.txt  file1_copy.txt  file2.txt
  ```

### Lab 3 Solution
- `mv` renames and moves files.
  ```bash
  $ mv file2.txt notes.txt
  $ mv notes.txt backup/
  $ ls backup
  file1.txt  file1_copy.txt  notes.txt
  ```

### Lab 4 Solution
- `rm` removes files, `rm -r` removes directories.
  ```bash
  $ rm backup/file1_copy.txt
  $ rm -r backup
  $ ls
  file1.txt
  ```

### Lab 5 Solution
- `cat`, `head`, and `tail` display file contents.
  ```bash
  $ echo -e "Line1\nLine2\nLine3" > file1.txt
  $ cat file1.txt
  Line1
  Line2
  Line3
  $ head -n 2 file1.txt
  Line1
  Line2
  $ tail -n 2 file1.txt
  Line2
  Line3
  ```

### Lab 6 Solution
- `file` shows type, `stat` shows stats, `diff` compares files.
  ```bash
  $ file file1.txt
  file1.txt: ASCII text
  $ stat file1.txt
  # (Shows file statistics)
  $ cp file1.txt file2.txt
  $ diff file1.txt file2.txt
  # (No output, files are identical)
  $ echo "Extra" >> file2.txt
  $ diff file1.txt file2.txt
  3a4
  > Extra
  ```
