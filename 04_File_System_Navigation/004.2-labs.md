# Module 4.2: Labs – Absolute and Relative Paths

## Lab 1: Navigate Using Absolute Paths
- Go directly to your Documents folder using an absolute path.
  ```bash
  $ cd /home/student/Documents
  $ pwd
  /home/student/Documents
  ```
- Go to the root directory, then to /tmp.
  ```bash
  $ cd /
  $ pwd
  /
  $ cd /tmp
  $ pwd
  /tmp
  ```

## Lab 2: Navigate Using Relative Paths
- From your home directory, enter a subfolder using a relative path.
  ```bash
  $ cd ~
  $ cd Documents
  $ pwd
  /home/student/Documents
  ```
- Go up one and two levels using `..` and `../..`.
  ```bash
  $ cd /home/student/Documents
  $ cd ..
  $ pwd
  /home/student
  $ cd ../..
  $ pwd
  /home
  ```

## Lab 3: Combine Absolute and Relative Paths
- Go to a directory using a mix of both.
  ```bash
  $ cd /home/student
  $ cd ./Documents
  $ pwd
  /home/student/Documents
  $ cd ../../tmp
  $ pwd
  /tmp
  ```

## Lab 4: Special Directory References
- Use `~`, `.`, `..`, and `-` in navigation.
  ```bash
  $ cd ~
  $ pwd
  /home/student
  $ cd .
  $ pwd
  /home/student
  $ cd ..
  $ pwd
  /home
  $ cd -
  /home/student
  ```

## Lab 5: Create and Navigate Custom Directory Structure
- Create a nested directory structure and practice moving between levels.
  ```bash
  $ mkdir -p ~/practice/level1/level2/level3
  $ cd ~/practice
  $ cd level1/level2/level3
  $ pwd
  /home/student/practice/level1/level2/level3
  $ cd ../../..
  $ pwd
  /home/student/practice
  ```

## Lab 6: Use Relative Paths for File Operations
- Create a file in a subdirectory using a relative path, then view it from another location.
  ```bash
  $ cd ~/practice
  $ touch level1/level2/level3/test.txt
  $ cat level1/level2/level3/test.txt
  # (empty output)
  $ cd level1/level2
  $ cat ../level2/level3/test.txt  # Incorrect, will fail
  $ cat level3/test.txt            # Correct
  ```

## Lab 7: Absolute vs Relative Path Copying
- Copy a file using both absolute and relative paths.
  ```bash
  $ cd ~/practice/level1/level2/level3
  $ echo "Hello" > test.txt
  $ cp test.txt /tmp/              # Absolute path
  $ cp test.txt ../../             # Relative path (to level1)
  $ ls /tmp/test.txt
  $ ls ../../test.txt
  ```

## Lab 8: Path Confusion Challenge
- Predict the result of each command before running it.
  ```bash
  $ cd ~/practice/level1/level2
  $ cd ../level2
  $ pwd
  ?
  $ cd ../../level1/../level1/level2/level3
  $ pwd
  ?
  ```
  Try to guess the output before running each command, then check your answer!

## Solutions

### Lab 5 Solution
- After running the commands:
  ```bash
  $ mkdir -p ~/practice/level1/level2/level3
  $ cd ~/practice
  $ cd level1/level2/level3
  $ pwd
  /home/student/practice/level1/level2/level3
  $ cd ../../..
  $ pwd
  /home/student/practice
  ```
  - The final output of `pwd` is `/home/student/practice`.

### Lab 6 Solution
- Creating and viewing the file:
  ```bash
  $ cd ~/practice
  $ touch level1/level2/level3/test.txt
  $ cat level1/level2/level3/test.txt
  # (empty output)
  $ cd level1/level2
  $ cat ../level2/level3/test.txt  # Incorrect, will fail: No such file or directory
  $ cat level3/test.txt            # Correct, shows empty output
  ```

### Lab 7 Solution
- Copying with absolute and relative paths:
  ```bash
  $ cd ~/practice/level1/level2/level3
  $ echo "Hello" > test.txt
  $ cp test.txt /tmp/              # Copies test.txt to /tmp
  $ cp test.txt ../../             # Copies test.txt to ~/practice/level1
  $ ls /tmp/test.txt               # Shows test.txt in /tmp
  $ ls ../../test.txt              # Shows test.txt in ~/practice/level1
  ```

### Lab 8 Solution
- Predicting the result:
  ```bash
  $ cd ~/practice/level1/level2
  $ cd ../level2
  $ pwd
  /home/student/practice/level1/level2
  $ cd ../../level1/../level1/level2/level3
  $ pwd
  /home/student/practice/level1/level2/level3
  ```
  - The first `pwd` returns `/home/student/practice/level1/level2` because `../level2` is the same as the current directory.
  - The second `pwd` returns `/home/student/practice/level1/level2/level3` because all the path simplifications resolve to that directory.
