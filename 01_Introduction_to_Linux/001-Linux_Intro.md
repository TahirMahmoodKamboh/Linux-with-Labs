# 1.1 What is an Operating System?

An Operating System (OS) is system software that acts as an interface between the computer hardware and the user/applications. It manages system resources and provides essential services required for programs to run.

Key Responsibilities of an Operating System

Process management (CPU scheduling)

Memory management

File system management

Device and hardware control

Security and access control

User interface (CLI / GUI)

Examples of Operating Systems

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- UNIX
- Android
- iOS

# Introduction to Linux

Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel. It is widely used for servers, desktops, and embedded systems due to its stability, security, and flexibility.

## History
- Created in 1991
- Created by Linus Torvalds
- At university of Helsinki
- Started in personal space, not formal lab
- Inspired by UNIX principles
- Combined with GNU tools → GNU/Linux
- Rapid adoption in servers, supercomputers, and cloud platforms

## Name Origin
- "Linux" = Linus + Unix
- Named after creator Linus Torvalds
- Combines his name with "Unix" (the OS family)

## Why Linux Became Popular

- Free to use and modify
- Strong community support
- Reliable and secure
- Ideal for servers and automation

## Key Features
- Open-source and free
- Highly customizable
- Strong community support
- Multitasking and multiuser capabilities

## Common Uses
- Web servers
- Development environments
- Personal computers
- IoT devices

## Popular Linux Distributions

Around 600 + Linux Distributions are available. 

Some of the popular Linux distributions are: 
- Ubuntu
- Fedora
- Debian
- CentOS
- RedHat

## Linux Interfaces
- GUI (Graphical User Interface): User-friendly, visual desktop environments (e.g., GNOME, KDE)
- CLI (Command Line Interface): Text-based, powerful for advanced users and automation
- The CLI is accessed through a shell program.

## Shell
- A shell is a program that runs on OS to provide command line interface
- Acts as a bridge between user and kernel
- Interprets commands entered by user
- Provides the CLI environment
- Examples: Bash, Zsh, Fish

## Open Source vs Proprietary Software

| Feature                | Open Source Software         | Proprietary Software         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Source Code Access     | Open and available           | Closed and restricted        |
| Modification           | Allowed and encouraged       | Not allowed                  |
| Cost                   | Usually free                 | Often requires purchase      |
| Collaboration          | Community-driven             | Company-controlled           |
| Distribution           | Free to share and distribute | Restricted by license        |
| Examples               | Linux, Firefox               | Windows, macOS               |


## Linux vs Windows vs macOS

| Feature       | Linux              | Windows       | macOS         |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| Cost          | Free               | Paid          | Paid          |
| Source Code   | Open Source        | Closed Source | Closed Source |
| Security      | Very High          | Moderate      | High          |
| Customization | Extremely Flexible | Limited       | Limited       |
| Server Usage  | Very High          | Moderate      | Low           |
| CLI Strength  | Very Strong        | Moderate      | Strong        |

## Open Source Concepts

Open Source Software allows users to:

- View source code
- Modify code
- Redistribute software

## Benefits of Open Source

- Transparency
- Security
- Community-driven improvements
- No vendor lock-in
- Cost-effective
